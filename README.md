# Yelp-Business-Data

NY Dining team is formed according to requirement of Data Explorotory and Analysis course (Stat 4701, Columbia University). We worked on Yelp Academeic Data set
http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge for around two weeks and finalized the results. I recorded my part, and also incorporated all work in this repository.

I visulized the report in R shiny in the end.
