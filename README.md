# Yelp-Business-Data

NY Dining team is formed according to requirement of Data Explorotory and Analysis course (Stat 4701, Columbia University). We worked on Yelp Academeic Data set http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge for around two weeks and finalized the results. I recorded my part-dashboard on stars and reviews,visualized the reports in R shiny, and also incorporated all work in this repository.

Nice work, guys:Lin He, Yang Liu, Yu Tian, Junfei Shen!


(plus, put bootstrap in new folder "www" to run the Shiny)
